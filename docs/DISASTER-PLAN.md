### 1. Geographic Data Collection

I've already added latitude/longitude fields to your form with a "Get Current Location" button. This gives you precise location data that will be crucial for:

- Identifying residents within specific flood zones
- Creating heatmaps of affected areas
- Planning targeted relief operations

### 2. Create a Household Management System

Consider implementing:

- A household ID field to group family members
- A "head of household" designation (which you already track)
- Total household member count
- Housing type (to assess vulnerability)

### 3. Develop a Disaster Event Management Module

Create a new module to:

```typescript
// Sample disaster event structure
interface DisasterEvent {
  id: string;
  name: string;              // "Typhoon Yolanda", "Flash Flood June 2023"
  type: string;              // Flood, Typhoon, Earthquake, etc.
  startDate: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  affectedAreas: {           // Areas affected with severity levels
    barangayId: string;
    severity: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High' | 'Critical';
    description: string;
  }[];
  status: 'Ongoing' | 'Resolved' | 'Recovery';
}
```

### 4. Implement an Impact Assessment System

Create a module to track how each resident/household was affected:

```typescript
// Sample impact record structure
interface DisasterImpact {
  id: string;
  disasterId: string;        // Link to specific disaster event
  residentId: string;        // Individual resident affected
  householdId?: string;      // Entire household affected
  impactDate: Date;
  evacuationStatus: 'Not Evacuated' | 'Evacuated' | 'Returned Home';
  evacuationCenterId?: string;
  injuryStatus: 'None' | 'Minor' | 'Moderate' | 'Severe';
  healthConcerns: string[];
  propertyDamage: 'None' | 'Partial' | 'Total';
  assistance: {              // Track assistance provided
    type: string;            // Food, Medical, Financial, etc.
    dateProvided: Date;
    quantity: string;
    providedBy: string;
  }[];
  notes: string;
}
```

### 5. Create Disaster-Specific Views and Reports

Develop pages for:

- Mapping affected residents
- Generating summary statistics (total affected, by vulnerability group)
- Relief distribution tracking
- Evacuation center management
- Recovery monitoring

### 6. Enhance the Current Form with Vulnerability Indicators

Add fields relevant to disaster vulnerability:

- Housing construction type (concrete, wood, etc.)
- Elevation or floor level (for flood risk)
- Specialized needs during evacuation
- Emergency contacts in and outside the area

### 7. Mobile-Friendly Data Collection

Develop a mobile-optimized form for rapid assessment during/after disasters when field teams need to quickly collect impact data.

### 8. Integration with Early Warning Systems

Consider integrating with:

- Weather APIs for automatic alerts
- SMS notification capabilities
- Evacuation coordination tools

### Implementation Approach

Start with these steps:

1. Enhance your database schema with the fields mentioned above
2. Add geo-tagging capabilities (already demonstrated)
3. Create the disaster event tracking module
4. Build the impact assessment module
5. Develop reporting dashboards with filtering capabilities

This approach will allow you to effectively track and respond to disaster impacts while building on your existing resident data system.
