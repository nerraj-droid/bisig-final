## Development Guidelines

1. Follow Git branch naming convention:

   - feature/feature-name
   - bugfix/bug-description
   - hotfix/fix-description

2. Commit message format:

   ```
   type(scope): description

   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation
   - style: formatting
   - refactor: code restructuring
   - test: adding tests
   - chore: maintenance
   ```

3. Code Review Process:

   - Create pull request
   - Request review from team members
   - Address feedback
   - Merge after approval

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Write unit tests for new features
   - Ensure all tests pass before merging
   - Maintain minimum 80% code coverage

This development plan spans approximately 10-15 weeks, depending on team size and velocity. Each phase can be adjusted based on specific needs and resources available.
