# Financial Management Tool Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

The BISIG Financial Management Tool will automate and streamline budget processing, financial reporting, expense tracking, and provide predictive analytics for barangay governments in the Philippines. This comprehensive system will be integrated directly into the existing BISIG platform, ensuring a unified experience while providing compliance with COA (Commission on Audit) regulations and increasing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in financial operations.

## Background on Barangay Budgeting in the Philippines

### Regulatory Framework

In the Philippines, barangay financial management is governed by several laws and regulations:
- **Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160)** - Establishes the fiscal administration framework
- **Government Accounting Manual (GAM)** - Provides accounting guidelines for government units
- **COA Circular No. 2012-002** - Prescribes the revised documentation requirements for disbursements
- **DILG MC No. 2018-189** - Guidelines on barangay financial management and accountability

### Barangay Budget Cycle

The barangay budget process follows an annual cycle:
1. **Budget Preparation** (July-September) - Formulation of annual budget by Barangay Treasurer and Development Council
2. **Budget Authorization** (October) - Review and approval by the Barangay Council through an Appropriation Ordinance
3. **Budget Review** (November) - Submission to the Sangguniang Panlungsod/Bayan for review
4. **Budget Execution** (January-December) - Implementation of approved budget
5. **Budget Accountability** (Continuous) - Recording, reporting, and auditing

### Key Financial Documents

Barangays are required to maintain and submit:
- Annual Barangay Budget (ABB)
- Barangay Financial Report (BFR)
- Statement of Cash Flow
- Statement of Financial Position
- Semi-annual Report on Sources and Application of Funds
- Report of Disbursements
